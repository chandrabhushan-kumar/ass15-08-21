All too often supervisor will mistakenly focus all of his or her resources entirely on rating and ranking the workforce, dolling out promotions or laying off workers as need be. While these steps are an essential element of performance management, they fall short in the long run. To begin with, employees are left feeling as though their company has neglected their individual career needs. This ultimately leads to higher employee turnover and makes it difficult for an organization to retain top quality talent. This is why effective performance management incorporates the workers’ needs with that of the company. When engaging an employee base on the level of their
                performance, the successful manager will work to align the company’s goals with those of the individualized career paths to ensure a high level of worker loyalty and long term productivity.
                One area of particular concern for performance management is a large and growing population of employees whose careers have reached the half way marker. For many employees, this is a crucial time for climbing up a few more steps on the corporate ladder. Unfortunately, the gaping absence of motivating organizational structure present in many business environments kills the career momentum for these people. This negatively affects the contribution made by these employees to the overall output and productivity on a corporate level.
                There are a variety of causes behind the lack of momentum within the halfway crowd. As mentioned before, lack of organization is a major culprit. This really stems from having little or no management at the top. Unfortunately, these important causes for the slowdown are seldom recognized, and the fault becomes that of the employees rather than the faulty system under which they work.
                In order to combat this dilemma, one approach that has enjoyed widespread success is the organized setting of goals. If an employee can visualize the steps it takes to achieve a promotion, he or she will proactively take up the challenge to improve his or her status. Another way to add to the challenge is to transfer an employee to a different job area. This allows the workers to learn new skills and become reignited in the process of advancement. A performance manger can even knock the employee down a rung or two before making a transfer. However, the supervisor should do so by showing the worker long term benefits of advancement and thus not packaging the transfer as a demotion that would lead to lower moral and productivity.
                Employees want to work hard and develop their careers, but they must be given
                the right incentive. By making the company’s increased productivity a shared goal between the employer and the employee, then positive results will be achieved on both sides.
